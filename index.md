## Professional Counseling Services

Do you worry about things that you cannot control? Are you enabling or rescuing others instead of taking care of yourself? This can happen when we love someone with an addiction or compulsion. I help treat anxiety that happens when one gives so much time and effort that they lose themselves in the process.

I also have extensive experience working with special-needs clients, particularly those on the autism scale. I relate to children and teens very well and can facilitate parent training for caretakers.
