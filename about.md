## About

Over ten years ago, I started counseling special-needs children and teens at schools, offices and in homes.

In 2009, I also began therapy services for adults who struggle with anxiety and depression due to codependency.

My specialties include:

* ADHD
* Anxiety
* Autism scale
* Behavioral issues
* Boundaries problems
* Codependency (enabling, rescuing behaviors)
* Parent education

I also provide Christian counseling upon request.
